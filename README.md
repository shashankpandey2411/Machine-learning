## Introduction :

we have made a  Dynamic working website for used car price prediction in our machine learning project where one can use it to predict the used car price based on factors that were asked on the website.

In our project, the training model was carried out by dividing the models by car brands instead of a single big model training for both effective optimization processes and better use of computer power and time. Approximately 8000-row data with 13 features were used in training. The machine learning models compared are:

## Linear regression

First of all, the models were trained with default parameters. Then, hyperparameter optimization was applied to these models. The parameter values ​​and estimates in both cases were recorded for later review.
